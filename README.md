## My Ergodox Setup

I built an Ergodox keyboard over the course of a few hack nights in March and April 2014.

After some research regarding what I had gotten myself into, I read Jason Trill's article on his [Ergodox adventure a year in](http://jjt.io/2013/11/25/why-any-developer-should-check-out-the-ergodox-keyboard/), and saw that he had posted links to his `.hex` file (the main thing you need to load onto your hardware on an Ergodox to define the layout you use), and enjoyed his commentary on using the Colemak layout for his Ergodox. I decided to try his setup, and am making modifications to it in these living setup files.
